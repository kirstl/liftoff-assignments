## Submission Instructions

### Overview
This app would depend on user-input to compile food dishes and drinks that are brought to parties and other gatherings. Many times people really enjoy a particular dish or beverage but have no idea what it is and therefore cannot purchase or attempt to make it. This app would allow people who attend a gathering to include information on food/drinks so that others can enjoy at a later time. The idea came from my own personal experience of asking party hosts who made a particular dish and them having to track the person down to get recipe information.

Search: Guests would be able to search for drink or food recipes.
